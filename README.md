**Cumulative Multiple-Niching Genetic Algorithm with Adaptive Sampling Variance-Covariance Matrix for Mahalanobis Distance Evaluation.**

This is a prototype code for the use in the upcoming SPARC program. Adaptive sampling of the Variance-Covariance matrix is usually not used for genetic algorithms (to the author's limited knowledge). Here, it makes up for the poorly sampled many-dimensional surface.
